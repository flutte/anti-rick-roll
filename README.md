# anti-rick-roll
never get rickrolled again!

# how it works?
it fetches the url's text and checks for user-specified keywords. You can extend them to detect other potential trolls, too, like Gnome Troll, or whatever the internet comes up with.
just put the keywords in the keywords.txt file (SEPERATE THEM BY LINES!)

# requirements
- python 3
- bs4
- requests

# todo
- ~~specify keywords in a seperate txt file and not within the code~~
- maybe a tkinter gui, too lazy to do front-end tho
