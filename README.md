# anti-rick-roll
never get rickrolled again!

# how it works?
it fetches the url's text and checks for user-specified keywords. You can extend them to detect other potential trolls, too, like Gnome Troll, or whatever the internet comes up with.

# requirements
- python 3
- bs4
- requests

# todo
specify keywords in a seperate txt file and not within the code
